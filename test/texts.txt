I want you to create HDDL problem file of the image that I give as input.
First, identify objects in the image and their types, including food (for example, apple, banana, etc.), containers (for example, plate, bowl, cup, basket), and other objects (listed as items).
For the location of the objects, use simply wp1s, wp2s etc, (for the start) and wp1f, wp2f etc, (for the goal); for example, (at plate1 wp1s) for the initial location of the plate1.
For the goal, only food and containers are allowed on the table.
Put food in containers and remove the other object from the tables, if they are not containers, place the food on waypoints.
The task you can use are: move_object (to move the objects) and move_to_container (to move objects to the container).
To move the objects, use (move_object object_to_move final_waypoint); to move the food, use (move_to_container food container).
Only output the generated hddl file.
